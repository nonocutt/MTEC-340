## Overview

- My favorite game is **_Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars_**, developed by **Square** (Now [Square Enix](https://www.square-enix.com)) and published by [Nintendo](https://www.nintendo.com) for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on March 9, 1996.

- The game was directed by *Chihiro Fujioka* and *Yoshihiko Maekawa*, produced by *Shigeru Miyamoto*, and scored by *Yoko Shimomura*.

- Like other SNES games, it is programmed with 65c816 assembly language.

## Reason of Choice

- The game combines elements of traditional turn-based RPGs with action-adventure mechanics.
- It has very rich and engaging story, and filled with humor.
- It introduces a lot of memorable characters.
- Because of the development in the late period of SNES, it has relatively high-quality graphics, animations, and music.
- It offers plenty of exploration, secrets, and side quests, which added depth and replayability, despite being only 4MB size.
